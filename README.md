# go-securityspy

Full Featured Go Library for [SecuritySpy](https://www.bensoftware.com/securityspy/)

Feedback is welcomed! Still working on it. Lots of docs to come.

`ffmpeg` is also used if you want video snippets, but not required for most functions.

My server doesn't have auth enabled, so I really have no idea if this works with a password. lemme know?

A command line interface app that uses this library exists. Most of the testing is done with this app.
