# go-securityspy
Full Featured Go Library for [SecuritySpy](https://www.bensoftware.com/securityspy/)

I wrote all this over the weekend, the events feed and much of the camera code is tested and works. Feedback is welcomed!

SecuritySpy and Cameras interfaces are complete.
The EventsStream code is done, and working.

Still working on it. Lots of docs to come. I hope.

`ffmpeg` is also used if you want video snippets.

My server doesn't have auth enabled, so I really have no idea if this works with a password. lemme know?
