# go-securityspy
Full Featured Go Library for SecuritySpy

I wrote all this over the weekend, and have only tested the code you see in the provided test app.

SecuritySpy and Cameras interfaces are pretty much done. Except PTZCapabilities.
The EventsStream code is done, and reasonably working.
The logic is there, and so are the bugs.

Still working on it. Lots of docs to come. I hope.

ffmpeg is also used if you want video snippets.

my server doesn't have auth enabled, so I really have no idea if this works with a password. lemme know?
