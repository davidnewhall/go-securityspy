# go-securityspy
Full Featured Go Library for SecuritySpy

I wrote all this over the weekend, and have not tested a single line of code.

SecuritySpy and Cameras interfaces are pretty much done. Except PTZCapabilities.
The EventsStream code is done, but again, untested.
The logic is there, and so are the bugs.

Still working on it. Lots of docs to come. I hope.

The only external vendor (so far) is "github.com/pkg/errors" and we may work this out with custom error types. I dunno.
