Full Featured Go Library for [SecuritySpy](https://www.bensoftware.com/securityspy/)

Everything is reasonably tested and working. Feedback is welcomed! Lots of docs to come.

`ffmpeg` is used if you want video snippets, but not required for most functions.

My server doesn't have auth enabled, so I really have no idea if this works with a password. lemme know?

A command line interface app that uses this library exists. Most of the testing is done with this app.
Find it here: https://github.com/davidnewhall/SecSpyCLI - full of great examples on how to use this library.


- Requires [SecuritySpy 4.2.10b7](https://www.bensoftware.com/securityspy/download-beta.html) or later.
